<h2>Grammatical Gender</h2>

<p>Grammatical gender is very important in Spanish because speakers must know the classification of pronouns, nouns and adjectives that concord. Although this language phenomenon is often described as arbitrary, in Spanish words are identified as masculine or feminine.
<hr>

<p>Every noun has a its own specific article that classifies and denotes the gender of the word.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>masculine singular &#8594; el</li>
  <li>masculine plural &#8594; los</li>
  <li>masculine singular &#8594; la</li>
  <li>masculine plural &#8594; las</li>
</ul>

<p>the rule conveys that the word a word ending with an -a are feminine and words ending with an -o is masculine.</p>

<span>
   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
      <dt>Masculine</dt>
      <dd>el ni単o &#8594; the boy</dd>
     <dd>los ni単os &#8594; the boys</dd>
   </dl>

   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
      <dt>Feminine</dt>
      <dd>la ni単a &#8594; the girl</dd>
        <dd>las ni単as &#8594; the girls</dd>
   </dl>
<span>
  
<hr>
<p>However, not all words in spanish end in -o or -a, and not all the words that end in -o or -a follow the rule. Like all rules in language there is an exeception to this.</p>

<span>
   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
      <dt>Masculine</dt>
      <dd>el mapa &#8594; the map</dd>
     <dd>los mapas &#8594; the maps</dd>
   </dl>

   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
      <dt>Feminine</dt>
      <dd>la foto &#8594; the photo</dd>
  <dd>las fotos &#8594; the photos</dd>
   </dl>
<span>
  
  <p>The examples shows words that do not follow the rule conveyed. These two words are often mistaken my learners of the language, but words like these that have an -o or sound like an -o at the beginning of the word and end with it, it usually takes the opposite gender.</p>
