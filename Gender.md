<h2>Grammatical Gender</h2>

<p>Grammatical gender is very important in Spanish because speakers must know the classification of pronouns, nouns and adjectives that concord. Although this language phenomenon is often described as arbitrary, in Spanish words are identified as masculine or feminine.
<hr>

<p>Every noun has a its own specific article that classifies and denotes the gender of the word.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>masculine singular &#8594; el</li>
  <li>masculine plural &#8594; los</li>
  <li>masculine singular &#8594; la</li>
  <li>masculine plural &#8594; las</li>
</ul>

<p>the rule conveys that the word a word ending with an -a are feminine and words ending with an -o is masculine.</p>

<span>
   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
      <dt>Masculine</dt>
      <dd>el ni単o &#8594; the boy</dd>
     <dd>los ni単os &#8594; the boys</dd>
   </dl>

   <dl style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
